# Blackjack
This was my first introduction to component based frameworks where my task was to create an app using a component based framework, working with an API. I decided to work with react and to make a Blackjack game based on a deck of cards API https://deckofcardsapi.com/.

I had a nice, simple goal, make blackjack and while the idea was simple it was harder than I anticipated. Figuring out features such as: betting, asking for more cards (hitting), losing (busting) with a value over 21, dealer showing only one card until users round is finished, dealer drawing automatically until a value over 16, Aces automatically going between 11 and 1, dynamically lining up the cards in a viewable manner, etc.

It was a lot of fun and taught me a lot about React and using API:s/JSON-files. I thought it was really cool to use states that automatically re-renders the site without having to use .innerHTML also being able to send those values to other components as props to use, WOW! The structure for the code was really nice aswell, using components kind of solves that problem on its own. All that code in one JS document, that would suck.
